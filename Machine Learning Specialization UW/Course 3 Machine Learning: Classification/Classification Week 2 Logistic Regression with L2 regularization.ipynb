However, the portion of data that we don't train on will be used to help select model parameters (this is known as model selection). Thus, this portion of data should be called a validation set. Recall that examining performance of various potential models (i.e. models with different parameters) should be on validation set, while evaluation of the final selected model should always be on test data. Typically, we would also save a portion of the data (a real test set) to test our final model on or use cross-validation on the training set to select our final model. But for the learning purposes of this assignment, we won't do that. "
