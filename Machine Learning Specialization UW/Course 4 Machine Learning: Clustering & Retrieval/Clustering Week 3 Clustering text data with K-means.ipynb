    "As discussed in the previous assignment, Euclidean distance can be a poor metric of similarity between documents, as it unfairly penalizes long articles. For a reasonable assessment of similarity, we should disregard the length information and use length-agnostic metrics, such as cosine distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The k-means algorithm does not directly work with cosine distance, so we take an alternative route to remove length information: we normalize all vectors to be unit length. It turns out that Euclidean distance closely mimics cosine distance when all vectors are unit length. In particular, the squared Euclidean distance between any two vectors of length one is directly proportional to their cosine distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can prove this as follows. Let x and y be normalized vectors, i.e. unit vectors, so that ∥x∥=∥y∥=1. Write the squared Euclidean distance as the dot product of (x−y) to itself:\n",

    "$∥x−y∥2=(x−y)T(x−y)=∥x∥2−2(xTy)+∥y∥2=2−2(xTy)=21−xTy∥x∥∥y∥$\n",

    "This tells us that two unit vectors that are close in Euclidean distance are also close in cosine distance. Thus, the k-means algorithm (which naturally uses Euclidean distances) on normalized vectors will produce the same results as clustering using cosine distance as a distance metric.\n",
